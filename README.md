Kindly Coin is a charity token running in the ETH and BSC chain. 

## Purpose & Functionalities of the Kindly Coin, Exchange and Wallet

The Kindly Coin is intended to be the world's first social-impact cryptocurrency simultaneously sold on the Ethereum (ETH) and Binance Smart Chain (BSC) Blockchains. Every transaction (buying or selling) of the Kindly coin will result in a 4% fee allocated to a Kindly charity wallet. However, unlike other “charity tokens” the Kindly coin will come with a guarantee of a measurable social impact. This will be achieved with the [OM Guarantee certification managed by feedOM](https://omguarantee.com/)

* 2.5% goes to Charity
* 0.9% goes to Maintenance (Team, OMG Certification)
* 0.3% goes to Liquidity Pools
* 0.3 is redistributed among holders
